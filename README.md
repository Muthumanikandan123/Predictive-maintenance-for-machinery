2.project documentation: 
overview :- 
This project documentation provides a clear and organized description of the predictive maintenance system developed for machinery. It covers the purpose, design, and implementation of using sensors, data collection, and machine learning to monitor equipment health and predict possible failures. The documentation includes details on system architecture, AI model development, IoT integration, data security, chatbot interaction, and testing processes. Its aim is to guide users and developers through how the system works, how to use it effectively, and how it improves maintenance by reducing downtime and costs. 
 Documentation sections 
•	system architecture : The system architecture consists of several connected components that work together to monitor and maintain machinery. Sensors are attached to the machines to collect real-time data such as temperature, vibration, and pressure. This data is sent to an IoT gateway, which processes and transfers it to a central server or cloud platform 
 
•	Code Documentation : This code collects real-time sensor data from machinery and processes it for analysis. It uses a trained machine learning model to predict potential equipment failures before they happen. The system also includes features for user interaction, data security, and performance monitoring. 
 
 
•	User Guide : Start the system to automatically collect and monitor machine data through connected sensors. Use the dashboard or chatbot to view machine status and receive early warnings about possible failures. Follow the alerts and suggested actions to perform timely maintenance and avoid breakdowns. 
 
•	Administrator Guide : Administrators are responsible for setting up and managing sensor devices, data storage, and system access. They should monitor system performance, update machine learning models when needed, and ensure data security is maintained. Regular system checks and backups are essential to keep the maintenance system running smoothly 
 
. 
•	Testing Report The system was tested using historical and real-time sensor data to validate prediction accuracy. Results showed that the model successfully identified potential failures with over 90% accuracy. The chatbot interface, data handling, and alert system were also tested and performed reliably under various conditions.
